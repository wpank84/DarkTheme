# DarkTheme

This is a simple Chrome extension that injects a custom stylesheet into chat.google.com. The stylesheet overrides several major classes resulting in a clean dark theme with much better balances than force toggling dark mode in Chrome. 


A link to the extension on the Chrome web store can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-for-google-cha/pamnohfceckgggjcmjabmnkgbpoldlcp?hl=en&authuser=1
